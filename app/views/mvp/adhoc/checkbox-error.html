              <h1>Get a redundancy estimate</h1>
              <p>Use this service to calculate redundancy estimates for NHS Pension Scheme members.</p>
              <h2>Before you start</h2>
              <p>We can only calculate redundancy estimates for members who meet certain criteria by their redundancy date. They must:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>have at least 2 years of qualifying membership within the Scheme</li>
                <li>have 2 years of continuous service verified by the employer</li>
                <li>have reached the minimum pension age of the Scheme they are part of</li>
                <li>not have a GP practice as their Employing Authority</li>
                <li>have redundancy provisions in place, if part of a direction body</li>
              </ul>

{{ insetText({
  html: "<p>If a member does not meet all of the criteria,  you need to inform the requesting employer that we cannot provide an estimate.</p>"
}) }}
      
              <h2>Completing the calculation</h2>
      
              <p>When you start the calculation, we'll ask you to enter all the member data we need to get an estimate. After the data is submitted, the service will create 2 documents:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A calculation sheet</li>
                <li>An estimate letter, which you'll need to send to the employer</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You should open the member's Compendia Touch record before starting.</p>
