<ul>
  <li>do not have pensions on divorce debit</li>
  <li>do not have additional pensions (APs)</li>
  <li>do not have an early retirement reduction buy-out (ERRBO)</li>
  <li>do not have transfers</li>
  <li>are not over the normal pension age (NPA)</li>
  <li>are not a McCloud comparison calculation</li>

<h3>If the member is affected</h3>
<p>You cannot complete the calculation using this service. The record will need to be allocated to the correct pension admin for this type of case. </p>
