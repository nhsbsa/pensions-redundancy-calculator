              <h1>Get a redundancy estimate</h1>
              <p>Use this service to calculate and send redundancy estimates for NHS Pension Scheme members.</p>

              <h2>Check if a member is eligible for redundancy </h2>
              
              <p>We can only calculate redundancy estimates for members who meet certain criteria by their redundancy date. They must:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>have at least 2 years of qualifying membership within the Scheme</li>
                <li>have 2 years of continuous service verified by the employer</li>
                <li>have reached the minimum pension age of the Scheme they are part of</li>
                <li>not have a GP practice as their employing authority</li>
                <li>have redundancy provisions in place, if part of a direction body</li>
              </ul>
      
              <h2>Before you start</h2>
              <p>Make sure the the member's Compendia record is open before you start.</p>

              <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
